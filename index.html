        <h1>4 Big Benefits of a Good Night's Sleep</h1>
        <h5>And how to get some</h5>

            <p><span class="special-y">Y</span> ou surely already know sleep is vital. It allows the mind and body to recharge. Sleep actually repairs damage that’s done to your brain while you’re awake and, presumably, thinking. It also gives the brain some quiet time to consolidate thoughts and experiences into long-term memories. Yes, a lot goes on while you’re not there. On the flip-side, lack of sleep is really bad for you. Here are four great reasons to sleep long and sound, followed by four science-backed strategies to help make it so.</p>

        <h3>1. Better mood</h3>
        <p>People who get a good night’s sleep experience more joy when something good happens the next day, and fewer negative emotions when something bad happens, according to new research in the journal Health Psychology. “When people experience something positive, such as getting a hug or spending time in nature, they typically feel happier that day,” says study leader says Nancy Sin, PhD, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia. “But we found that when a person sleeps less than their usual amount, they don’t have as much of a boost in positive emotions from their positive events.” The findings add to a sea of research linking good sleep to lower stress and anxiety and better moods.</p>

        <h3>2. Sharper wits</h3>
        <p>Poor sleep affects the brain in every way imaginable. It reduces your ability to pay attention, hampers reasoning and decision-making skills, as well as language ability and learning, and it dulls the memory. Oh, and now scientists say lack of sleep can cause your brain to simply slow down, similar to being drunk. That increases reaction time, which could be dangerous when, I don’t know, driving?</p>

        <h3>3. Better physical health</h3>
        <p>Lack of sleep is really bad for you. It’s linked to increased risk of depression, Alzheimer’s disease, heart attacks and many other ills. People who sleep less than six hours a night have, on average, a 27% higher risk of developing clogged arteries that can choke blood flow to the heart or brain. Poor sleep even makes pain worse. Volunteers in a study were deprived of sleep, then scientists applied “uncomfortable heat” to their legs (the only thing I love more than science are these volunteers). The sleep-deprived brains actually amplified the sensation of pain and also cut back on the production of pain-reducing dopamine, compared to the brains of people who’d slept normally.</p>

        <h3>4. Cleaner brain</h3>
        <p>Among sleep’s most important functions is to clear your head, quite literally. When you’re awake and thinking and doing, the brain’s activity creates byproducts, bits of “garbage” like cast-off proteins and damaged genes. A bunch of channels or tunnels called the glymphatic system, whatever that is, surround the brain and act like a trash collection system, clearing the detritus out. The system — only recognized fairly recently by scientists and not fully understood— works best when you sleep, it seems, and if all goes well, it helps prevent mental decline later in life.
